It includes two main HTML pages: one for login and registration forms and another for a secured page accessible only after successful login. The CSS styles the form containers, giving them a modern, animated look with hover and active states, while JavaScript manages user registration and login processes. The users' passwords are hashed for basic security, and users are stored in an array. Upon registration, the system checks for existing users to prevent duplicates. During login, it verifies credentials and uses session storage to track the logged-in user. If login is successful, the user is redirected to the secured page where a personalized welcome message is displayed, and there's an option to log out, which clears the session and redirects back to the login page. Together, these files create a visually appealing Login Authentication System.
